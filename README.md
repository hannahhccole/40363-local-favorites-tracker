## Project 2 Reflection

	Building a local favorites tracker as Project 2 was a great learning experience, and fun to see what JavaScript adds to a website. I built a site that allows you to input your local favorites, such as restaurants, coffee shops, parks, etc., and store them on the site. This project allowed me to have a greater technical understanding of coding, practice problem-solving, and create something useful in the real world.

	Adding JavaScript to this project was both very interesting and challenging. It took a little longer for me to grasp what was happening with JavaScript than it did for HTML and CSS. HTML controls the actual words and is the “backbone” of the page. CSS adds the color and design. However, JavaScript makes the page interactive. It allows you to create functions that can be called and repeated. Another useful addition in this project was localStorage, which allows the user to add a local favorite box and save it, even after they leave or refresh the page. This is incredibly useful as you don’t have to start over each time you visit the site. I also added eventListeners to allow more interaction on my site. EventListeners wait for an event to occur, like a click of a button, and then respond by running code to carry out a task. An example of this is the “clear all” button on the local favorites site. When the user pushes this button, it signals the eventListener, which clears any favorites stored on the site. These are just a few of the many technical elements I learned and worked with during this project. 

	The most challenging part of this project was probably when we were originally learning what JavaScript is and how it works. For the first week or so, I felt like I was just copying code into my project, not understanding what each function was doing. However, the more I worked with and stopped to read the JavaScript, the more I understood it. The only major roadblock I ran into was when adding the localStorage. After first completing the section to add localStorage, my entries were not saving. However, I was able to solve this problem in a few steps. First, I went back and deleted all the changes I had made to that section to start fresh. Next, I made sure to follow the directions exactly. Upon doing this, I discovered my error and was able to get my favorites to save to the site. For optional enhancements, I added a few to both the CSS and JavaScript. To JavaScript, I added code to check that required fields aren’t empty, a clear all button, smooth transitions, and keyboard navigation. To the CSS, I added code to implement better spacing and alignment throughout the page. These changes help my page have a cleaner and more professional look, and make it more accessible for others to use. I used the AI built into VS Code to help with a few different things. The first was when I was making the enhancements and noticed my localStorage wasn’t working. I asked AI not to make any changes to the code but to help me identify which of my enhancements was causing the problem. Ultimately, I was able to fix the problem. I also asked it to tell me how I could center my “showing x of y favorites” text above where all of the favorites are stored. It gave me a line of code to add to my CSS, and the line was centered. I was able to use AI as a tool to further enhance my work, while still understanding what was happening with the code.

	To make this app ready for real-world use, a few changes might need to be made. The first one that comes to mind is making the names of the places clickable links that take you to the website of the place. This would be more convenient for users and would give them a quicker path to the sites of their favorite places. You could also add a feature that allows you to organize the favorites into folders based on category. It would help organize the page and make it easier for users to find the place they are looking for. This would be especially useful if the user had a large number of favorites stored on the tracker. 

	Overall, this project taught me a lot about the different uses of JavaScript and how it can be used to enhance HTML and CSS. I learned new technical skills regarding JavaScript, how to solve coding-related problems, and how my project can be applied in the real world. It was a valuable learning experience, and I significantly improved my coding abilities during this project.
